- We will need the schedule fsm to be supervised, so if
it crashes it can recover properly. This will need to be well
thought out.

- We need to implement schedule restarting on scheduler restart

- When the scheduler is going down, we need to "save" or "stop" 
all ongoing schedules

- Need to support different HTTP methods, HTTP headers, etc
when submitting url


- We should not be able to re-create and "EXISTING" schedule, only update it.

- Why can't we create schedules with 'atom' names?
