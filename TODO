- We will need the schedule fsm to be supervised, so if
it crashes it can recover properly. This will need to be well
thought out.

- We still need to figure out how to persist schedules properly
so we can restart them when the scheduler is starting up.

- When the scheduler is going down, we need to "save" or "stop" 
all ongoing schedules
