- We will need the schedule fsm to be supervised, so if
it crashes it can recover properly. This will need to be well
thought out.

- We need to properly test the schedule resurrection features
that have been implemented.

- We need to move the multiple fsms into just one fsm

- Need to support different HTTP methods, HTTP headers, etc
when submitting url

- Why can't we create schedules with 'atom' names?

- /stats/ service is not yet implemented
